GAMES

This is a collection of games I am adding to one file (playgame.py). Right now, the only two that actually work are Guess and Dice, which, I will admit are not that fun. I hope to add the following games to this:

-Hangman (about 80% done)
-Snake
-Connect 4

We'll see how it goes after that.
